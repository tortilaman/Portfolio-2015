			<h2>The Opening</h2>
			<p>
				This project presented unique challenges because my team and I had to choose our client. When trying to evaluate a core business problem in potential clients, EB Games stood out because the sector as a whole is in the midst of a shift from physical media to digital distribution. EB Games financial reports from the previous two years supported our theory that EB Games was struggling with this transition. A majority of their income is from the sale of new or used physical media, both of which were declining.
			</p>
			<p>
				In spite of this potential weakness in their business, EB Games had a lot of inherent strengths as well. A couple examples are their extensive network of physical retail outlets, and large library of classic games.

			<h2>Our Solution</h2>
			<p>
				Our goal was to give EB Games a unique differentiator that would leverage their strength in physical media in the short term, while providing the opportunity to move into digital media down the road. We created a subscription video game rental service that we feel provides customers with unique value and enables them to have unique experiences not otherwise available.
