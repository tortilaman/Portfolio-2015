			<h2>Opening</h2>
			<p>
				This project presented unique challenges because my team and I had to choose our client. When trying to evaluate a core business problem in potential clients, EB Games stood out because the sector as a whole is in the midst of a shift from physical media to digital distribution. EB Games financial reports from the previous two years supported our theory that EB Games was struggling with this transition, as a majority of their income is from the sale of new or used physical media, both of which were declining.
			</p>
			<h2>Concept</h2>

			<p>
				Our goal was to give EB Games a unique differentiator that would leverage their strength in physical media in the short term, while providing the opportunity to move into digital media down the road. We created a subscription video game rental service that we feel provides customers with unique value and enables them to have unique experiences not otherwise available.

				Unique to Vanguard was the option to rent console hardware and peripherals. We envisioned this allowing customers to have Rockband parties on a whim without the need to actually own the hardware.
